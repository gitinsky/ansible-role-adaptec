# Adaptec role

# Deprecated! See [hwraid role](https://github.com/gitinsky/ansible-role-hwraid)

Designed for ubuntu, could be easily updated to support debian.

You might also like to install new [smartmontools](https://github.com/gitinsky/ansible-role-smartmontools) (seems to be 6.4 or later) with aacraid driver support.
